## What is it?

A site where you can find and add vegan recipes. Share your special cruelty free recipes and discover new flavors, while helping the Earth, people and of course, animals.

## Features:
* View all recipes
* Add Recipes
* Allows you to review recipe form and go back to make changes
* View Specific Recipe
* About Page
* Contact Us

## Some features to add would be:

* Filters by categories, names, and ingredients
* Landing page
* Home page
* Contact page send email
* Cloud services like aws to store user submitted photos of their recipes
* User signup /login
* Likes, watched, created, and ratings
* Update and destroy recipes
* Categories components
* Update form to make it an easier experience to create a recipe (update some text fields to dropdowns)
* Allow users to remove non vegan recipes

Feel free to add suggestions on my github :)!

### My experience:

I have been learning Reactjs these past few days. This project was meant to finally put what I've learned into practice. I wanted to build something using modern technologies (Rails 5 to create my own API and React). Also, I wanted it to be useful. I have looked up existing recipe apps, but none cater to a specific community, vegans. They have vegan options but in my experience, even when I searched for vegan options, I was still shown non vegan options.

### Rails 5

I love rails. There, I said it. It handles the complexity of the database and allows you to create an API way too easily. In a couple of hours, I was able to have an API with many routes and even a create option. It feels very intuitive to me and it is easy to update and maintain.   

### Reactjs

Something about coding with Reactjs feels right. The way it is designed makes it more logical for programmers to follow. It separates all the components of a page into their own bit sized pieces. It follows the separation of concerns pattern. This image is the best description of it. ![](https://www.rithmschool.com/content/react_fundamentals/react_separation_of_concerns.png)

### Final Thoughts

Out of all the technologies I've used to make websites, this is my favorite. A lot of the common problems one faces are already fixed and done, and I can focus on what makes my website unique, in this case, a vegan recipes site. In particular, what makes it stand out is the  community and how centered it is around them. Letting them remove non vegan content themselves and rate other recipes.
