### **What is it?**

It is a simple portfolio website. It stores all your different projects, helping people keep track of their achievements. This is especially useful to keep record and feel proud of what you've done. 

* You can store pictures and links of all those tutorials you've done or all those final projects of classes that just get forgotten most of the time. 
* It lets you look at other people's projects, letting you have a better idea of what they have worked with.  
* Look at popular projects to see what is being done by others 
* Look at liked projects to see what people enjoy seeing

### **Demo**

Test the site [here](https://ididportfolio.herokuapp.com).


### **Future Work**

Some features to add would be: 
* filter projects based on views, likes
* add tags to projects
* filter projects based on tags
* filter projects based on location (see projects done near you)
* add location to projects 
* upgrade to rails 
* be able to upload pictures and files, instead of image and file links

Feel free to add suggestions on my [github](https://github.com/kyoung90/iDidPortfolio) :)!

### **My experience** 

I had a blast working with Sinatra. It is very similar to nodejs, which I have had previous experience working with in the past. I used [corneal](https://github.com/thebrianemory/corneal), which is a ruby gem that allows you to generate websites with Sinatra way faster. I highly recommend it to anyone using Sinatra. 

For this project, I wanted to make a website as practical as possible. I learned that keeping track of your successes and accomplishments is an excellent skill for the 21st century. To help others with this, I wanted to make a tool to make this easier than it is, since it isn't being done my many. It would impact a lot of people's lives in a positive way. 

Design is vital to a website. If a website doesn't look good, it won't be used. I applied bootstrap to help make the page look nicer, but it is something I want to revisit afterwards to make it more useful, attractive, and intuitive. 

I will keep working on this idea when I gather more knowledge and skills to improve it. If it improves the life of just one person, then it will have definitely been worth it.
