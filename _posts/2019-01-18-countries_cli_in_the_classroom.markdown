The acronym CLI stands for Command Line Interface and it is a program that you can run in the [terminal](https://askubuntu.com/questions/38162/what-is-a-terminal-and-how-do-i-open-and-use-it) of a computer. Countries_cli  allows you to look for basic information about every country in the world in a nice readable format.  That's right, information of every country in the world by just typing a few instructions. The program has different search methods that allow students to use critical thinking to find the country they are looking for. 

Installing:
This program is so easy to install, you don't need to be an expert to download it. Anyone can do it. All you have to do is follow this [simple guide](https://github.com/kyoung90/country) on how to install it on this link. There is also a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaclmq-m1uY&t=2s) that shows you how to do it.   

This program lets teachers educate students by challenging them. For example: They could be asked to find particular information about a country. Also, there are many different ways to search countries, which means there is more than one correct answer on challenges. This encourages individuality and problem solving.

* Presenting Tool for Teachers
Showing information to students in real time in a way that is out of the ordinary is made possible by countries_cli.

*  Learning Based on Discovery
Students could use it as a search engine to discover facts about a country by themselves. Instead of the teacher telling them to compare certain information, he/she can let them make the connection on their own. 

Countires_cli  would make a great resource for the classroom. It shows facts about a country in a single place. This is beneficial because, compared to searching on the internet where there is a lot of information, this cli goes straight to the point. 

It only takes a few minutes to start experimenting with it, and it promotes key skills needed for today's world. Technology and teaching are best buddies in the 21st century. They allow the ability to deepen knowledge and encourages students to explore by themselves.

Happy searching! :)
