I've always liked challenges. Back when I was a senior in High School, I had some exposure to technology. I remember I had to do community work, and my tech teacher told me that I could do it fixing the computers in the school. I had dabbled in some tech related projects in some Saturday courses. I made phone apps using MITAppInventor and  I had used AR  to make a children's book. Everybody looked at me as if I was hacker, and that felt great, but I still had no clue what I wanted to study. Since I had good grades (4.0 gpa), I figured I could study the hardest thing available. I got into university to study Computer Engineering (it had the highest gpa requirement of all bachelor degrees). The thought of being challenged was exciting. 

In my first programming class, I learned almost nothing. I survived and got a B, but it didn't feel like it was my thing. I thought to myself that I couldn't change degrees now so I kept going, and I'm glad I did. My next programming class was amazing. That was when I fell in love with coding.  It is always a constant challenge, and its based mostly on logic, which is one of my best attributes. Most of my decisions, I base them on logic so it was an instant fit. In coding, the capabilities to grow are limited only by yourself. It also allows you to have an impact on a lot of people's lives and change them for the better. It gives you the tools to solve real problems and contribute to society. 

I got into a school association called Hack Turabo. They helped me understand that I could continue learning by myself if I set my mind to it. They introduced me to Udemy, and that empowered me to continue learning to code more. 

After a while, I got an opportunity to tutor freshmen in University. I remember a life coach told me that the thing you wanna be in life is usually what you first wanted to be as a kid. To me, that was being a teacher. I accepted the opportunity, and it definitely was a rewarding experience. I discovered my passion for teaching. There's  something about helping others realize their dreams that fills me with joy. I get fired up just thinking about it. 

Learning to code is empowering. It makes you feel capable. It is also very challenging and sometimes, frustrating to get into. The initial learning curve is somewhat high. That's why I want to mix my passions of teaching and coding by teaching others how to code. I want to be that guide that helps them get over their obstacles and reach their goals.
